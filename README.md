[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

### Autoswipe configurable tinder bot.

### Requirements

Tinder_Bot uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) - chrome-webdriver installed and matched with the current version of chrome installation.
* [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) install it via ``` pip3 install selenium ```.
* [Python 3.7 or later](https://python.org) The core programming language for the python fork of this project.
* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) The core programming language for the ruby fork of this project.


##### Make sure to fill your credentials in the secrets file depending on the language you're gonna work with.
##### If the bot failed at login stage on tinder with you just restart it.

Please run with:

```sh
python3 tinder_bot.py 
```
Not with:

```sh
python tinder_bot.py 
```

For the ruby version, the following is just enough:

```sh
ruby tinder_bot.rb
```
